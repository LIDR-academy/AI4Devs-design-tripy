# First prompt

I want to create the results page according to the figma design @https://www.figma.com/design/7go5dVzlRcVtAJI2IFAs2e/Tripy-%F0%9F%8F%9D-%7C-Travel-Landing-Page--Community-?node-id=108-258&m=draw

Use the created components in @components.css and create new ones like result card or pagination if needed

# Sidebar design

Develop an alternative version results2.html taking into account that in the original design, the filters were placed in the left, and results in the right. I would say you put only 2 results per row, using the 1/3 for the filters. Inspire in the design proposed, where some of the filters are not selectors, but checkboxes, sliders...

# Sidebar functionality and mock data

@results-sidebar.html 

# Format
Use vanilla JS but apply best practices
